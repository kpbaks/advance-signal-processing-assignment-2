Structure of the report

% 1. Introduction
% 2. Problem statement (ecg data)
% 2.5 Hypothesis (lms is good for problem)
% 3. Data analysis using different methods
% 3.1 LMS
% 3.2 NMLS
% 3.3 LMS as adaptive line enhancer
% 3.4 RLS
% 4. Conclusion
%   LMS is the best method for this problem, as
%   it is the most simple and the most robust.
%   The problem domain is does not consist of a rapidly varying non-stationary signal,
%   A ecg signal is measured at a medical clinic, where the patient is resting.
%   The signal will therefore be expected to be stationary, as the patients heart rate is not expected to change rapidly.
%   over the course of the measurement.
%   Likewise the 50Hz noise is not expected to change rapidly, as the noise is caused by the power grid, although that is not to say
%   that it is stationary as the power grid is not expected to be perfectly stable.
